# Alpha Edge Daily

> Your daily dose of actionable market intelligence.

An autonomous, AI-powered **Quantitative Alpha Engine** that scrapes 70+ RSS feeds, ranks stories by importance, and generates economically rigorous yet razor-sharp, contrarian market commentary—like if a ruthless hedge fund manager had a PhD in Economics and a grudge against the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

**No human in the loop. Just vibes, scheduled triggers, and the Euler equation.**

## 🧠 The "Alpha Edge Strategist" Engine

Powered by **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and a proprietary knowledge base of economic theory (from Cobb-Douglas to the Todaro Paradox), this system doesn't just summarize news—it mathematically proves why the news is stupid.

### Features

- **Dense Economic Analysis:** High-entropy commentary that respects your time and insults your intelligence
- **Quantitative Alpha:** We don't just say "inflation is bad"; we calculate the shift in the Phillips Curve
- **Market Predictions:** Specific, bold, contrarian (but theoretically grounded) actionable predictions
- **Theory Citations:** Every take is backed by actual economic laws—Keynesian Multiplier, Deadweight Loss, CAPM, you name it
- **LaTeX Equations:** Because nothing says "I'm right" like $Y = AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$

### Output Format

Each story now includes:

```markdown
### 1. WHEN CENTRAL BANKS PLAY MUSICAL CHAIRS WITH INTEREST RATES

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** Fed raised rates by 25bps, affecting Household
consumption via the Euler equation and Firm investment through higher
cost of capital.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Look, when $u'(c_t) = \beta(1+r)u'(c_{t+1})$
> and you JACK UP that $r$, households rationally defer consumption.
> But here's the thing—the Fed assumes rational agents, and I've
> MET humans. The MPC of the lowest quintile (0.218) means stimulus
> leaks straight to landlords anyway...

**📈 Market Call:** Short consumer discretionary; the Euler equation
says patience just got more expensive.

**📚 Theory:** Euler Equation, Keynesian Multiplier

## What It Does

Every morning at 7 AM IST, this system autonomously:

1. Wakes up and scrapes **70+ RSS feeds** from India, US, China, and global tech/business sources
2. Ranks stories using **TF-IDF scoring + keyword importance weighting**
3. Feeds top stories to **Claude 3 Haiku** with an alpha-focused system prompt
4. Generates for each story:
   - **Catchy title** - Captures the real story the headline is hiding
   - **"What happened"** - TL;DR so you don't need to click the link
   - **"The take"** - High-conviction commentary that makes you rethink your portfolio
5. Emails the digest to subscribers
6. Publishes to a live website with calendar navigation
7. Goes back to sleep

## Ranking Algorithm

Stories are ranked using a hybrid scoring system:

### 1. Keyword Importance Scoring
```python
PRIORITY_KEYWORDS = {
    'high': ['recession', 'inflation', 'rate cut', 'fed', 'rbi', 'gdp',
             'layoff', 'acquisition', 'ipo', 'bankruptcy', 'sanctions',
             'tariff', 'openai', 'regulation', 'crisis', 'war', ...],
    'medium': ['earnings', 'profit', 'revenue', 'stock', 'market',
               'election', 'trade', 'startup', 'funding', 'merger', ...],
    'low': ['update', 'report', 'analysis', 'review', 'launches', ...]
}
```

### 2. TF-IDF Scoring
Custom implementation (no sklearn dependency) that weights terms by:
- Term frequency in headline
- Inverse document frequency across all headlines
- Priority keyword boost

### 3. Deduplication
MD5 hash-based deduplication to remove near-duplicate stories across sources.

## The Alpha Edge Persona

The system prompt creates a commentator with:

- **a ruthless hedge fund manager's** euphemism hunting ("synergies" = "we're firing people")
- **Hunter S. Thompson's** gonzo energy
- **Richard Feynman's** BS detection
- **Internet culture** fluency (ALL CAPS, parenthetical asides, memes)

Key traits:
- Translates corporate speak to plain English
- Finds the buried lede
- Punches up at systems, never down at people
- Celebrates rare Ws with suspicious enthusiasm

## Output Format

Each story includes:

```markdown
### 1. CATCHY TITLE IN ALL CAPS

**What happened:** 2-3 sentence summary of the actual news,
so you don't need to click the link.

> **The take:** Contrarian commentary with razor-sharp insight,
> (parenthetical asides), and internet energy. Goes off on
> the absurdity while being genuinely informative.

## Cost Breakdown

Running this system costs approximately **$1.50 - $2.00 per month** with the Sonnet upgrade.

| Service | Usage | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| AWS Lambda | ~1,500 GB-seconds | **FREE** (free tier) |
| AWS Bedrock (Sonnet) | ~300K tokens | **~$1.50** |
| AWS S3 | ~500 KB | **FREE** |
| AWS SES | 30 emails | **FREE** |
| GitHub Pages | Hosting | **FREE** |

### Per-Run Metrics
- **Duration:** ~60-90 seconds (more reasoning)
- **Memory:** 512 MB (~180 MB used)
- **Input tokens:** ~5,000 (includes economic context)
- **Output tokens:** ~5,000 (dense analysis)
- **Cost per run:** ~$0.05

*Note: Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet instead of Haiku for better economic reasoning. Worth every basis point.*
